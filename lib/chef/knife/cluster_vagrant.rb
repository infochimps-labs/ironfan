    # Vagrant support is VERY rough. It will
    #
    # * change the ui/commandline args, at the worst possible moment for you to adapt
    # * show you info that is inaccurate, even beyond the obvious fact that it reports AWS properties.
    # * translate your documents into swahili, make your TV record Gigli -- [tracker issue here](http://bit.ly/vrsalert)
    #
    # Vagrant has a really strong narcissistic streak, even more so than chef
    # and ironfan already do.  I don't want to fight (it's probably that way for
    # good reasons), so the following oddball procedure may persist until it a)
    # stops working well or b) someone recommends a better approach.
    #
    # when you run `knife cluster vagrant command cluster-[facet-[indexes]]` we:
    #
    # * identify all servers defined on that cluster
    # * find (or make) the directory config.vagrant_path
    #   - if unset, will use `{homebase}/vagrants/{cluster_name}`
    # * copy a special-purpose vagrantfile into that directory
    #   - it is called vagrantfile, but won't work in a standalone way.
