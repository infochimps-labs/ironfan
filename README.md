# Ironfan Core: Knife Tools and Core Models

Ironfan, the foundation of The Infochimps Platform, is an expressive toolset for constructing scalable, resilient architectures. It works in the cloud, in the data center, and on your laptop, and it makes your system diagram visible and inevitable. Inevitable systems coordinate automatically to interconnect, removing the hassle of manual configuration of connection points (and the associated danger of human error).
For more information about Ironfan and the Infochimps Platform, visit [infochimps.com](http://www.infochimps.com/).

This repo implements:

* Core models to describe your system diagram with a clean, expressive domain-specific language
* Knife plugins to orchestrate clusters of machines using simple commands like `knife cluster launch`
* Logic to coordinate truth among chef server and cloud providers

## Getting Started

To jump right into using Ironfan, follow our [Installation Instructions](https://github.com/infochimps-labs/ironfan/wiki/INSTALL).

* [ironfan-pantry](https://github.com/infochimps-labs/ironfan-pantry): Our collection of industrial-strength, cloud-ready recipes for Hadoop, HBase, Cassandra, Elasticsearch, Zabbix and more.
* [silverware cookbook](https://github.com/infochimps-labs/ironfan-pantry/tree/master/cookbooks/silverware): coordinate discovery of services ("list all the machines for `awesome_webapp`, that I might load balance them") and aspects ("list all components that write logs, that I might logrotate them, or that I might monitor the free space on their volumes".
