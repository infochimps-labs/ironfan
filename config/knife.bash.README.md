# knife bash completion

## Installation
=================
1)	Place the file knife.bash where bash expects to find it's autocompletion scripts.
		On most modern unices this would equate to '/etc/bash_completion.d/'. This has
		been verified in, at least, Ubuntu and Gentoo.
2)	Restart your shell.
3)	Enjoy tab-completion of your knife commands.
