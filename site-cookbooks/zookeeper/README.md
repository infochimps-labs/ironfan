# zookeeper chef cookbook

Installs/Configures zookeeper

## Overview

This cookbook installs zookeeper from the Cloudera apt repo.

The server recipe additionally
* creates the service, and applies the state given in `node[:zookeeper][:server][:daemon_state]`
* announces zookeeper-server

## Attributes

* `[:apt][:cloudera][:force_distro]`  - Override the distro name apt uses to look up repos
  - Typically, leave this blank. However if (as is the case in Nov 2011) you are on natty but Cloudera's repo only has packages up to maverick, use this to override.
* `[:apt][:cloudera][:release_name]`  - Release identifier (eg cdh3u2) of the cloudera repo to use. See also hadoop/deb_version (default: "cdh3u2")
