# commitlog_sync supports the following modes:

# batch:
# In batch mode, Cassandra won't ack writes until the commit log
# has been fsynced to disk.  But fsyncing each write at once is
# performance-prohibitive, so instead Cassandra will wait up to
# commitlog_sync_batch_window_in_ms milliseconds for other writes, before
# syncing that "batch" at once.  This causes a performance penalty
# of about 15% when the commitlog is on a separate device, and much more
# when it shares the same device as the data files.
#
# periodic:
# Writes may be acked immediately (without waiting for the commitlog
# append) and the CommitLog is simply synced every
# commitlog_sync_period_in_ms milliseconds.
#
# periodic_without_flush:
# Like periodic, but the commitlog write buffer is only flushed
# before the sync, so any interruption to the process can be
# expected to lose some writes.  This is the old 0.6 periodic
# behavior and will be removed in future versions if testing
# continues to show no performance benefit over normal periodic.
