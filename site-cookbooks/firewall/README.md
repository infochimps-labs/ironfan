# firewall chef cookbook

Installs/Configures firewall

## Overview

Defines custom iptable rules when the original cookbook doesn't define iptables
rules or there is no cookbook (for example, ssh).

## Attributes

* `[:firewall][:port_scan]`           -  (default: "{ :window => 5, :max_conns => 20, :port => 22 }")
  - The recipe 'firewall::port_scan' will search for all properties named 'node[:firewall][:port_scan_*]'. This will create a rule that allows only ':max_conns' connections with a window period of ':window' seconds. For example, the settings above state that a maximum of 20 connections  can be made to the ssh port (22) within a period of 5 seconds. If any more than that are made within 5 seconds, the source will automatically be dropped.

## Recipes 

* `default`                  - Base configuration for firewall
* `port_scan`                - Port Scan
## Integration

Supports platforms: debian and ubuntu

Cookbook dependencies:
