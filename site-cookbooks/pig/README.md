# pig chef cookbook

Installs pig, a data analysis program for hadoop. It's like SQL but awesome and infinitely scalable.

## Overview

This cookbook

* installs the package, from either the release (tarball available directly from the Apache Pig project) or the Cloudera apt repo.
* builds the piggybank of helper functions, if desired
* links to external jars and .confs (hbase, zookeeper, etc)

## Attributes

* `[:pig][:home_dir]`        - Location of pig code (default: "/usr/lib/pig")
* `[:pig][:install_url]`     - URL of pig release tarball (default: "http://apache.mirrors.tds.net/pig/pig-0.9.1/pig-0.9.1.tar.gz")
* `[:pig][:java_home]`       - JAVA_HOME environment variable to set for compilation. This should be the path to the 'jre' subdirectory of your Sun Java install (*not* OpenJDK). (default: "/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/jre")
* `[:pig][:extra_jars]`      - List of filenames for other jars to place within pig's purview. FIXME: integration cookbook
* `[:pig][:extra_confs]`     - List of filenames for other systems' conf files to place within pig's purview
* `[:pig][:combine_splits]`  - Processing input (either user input or intermediate input) from multiple small files can be inefficient because a separate map has to be created for each file. Pig can now combined small files so that they are processed as a single map. combine_splits turns this on or off. (default: "true")

## Recipes 

* `default`                  - Base configuration for pig
* `install_from_package`     - Installs pig from the cloudera package -- verified compatible, but on a slow update schedule.
* `install_from_release`     - Install From the release tarball.
* `integration`              - Link in jars from hbase and zookeeper
* `piggybank`                - Compiles the Piggybank, a library of useful functions for pig
